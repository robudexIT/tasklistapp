# taskListApp
This Project is my own version of TodoList 


# For s3-apigateway-lambdanode-dynamodb Branch.
 This branch turns project into complete serverless architecture.
 The App functionality is still the same, but the approach is different
 The Idea is creating App without spinning any server. Just focus on the code
 and let AWS handle the rest. On that regards, we will change our architecture into:
 
- Lambda - Backend (nodejs runtime)
- S3 -    FrontEnd 
- DATABASE: DYNAMODB
- ( very simple app with no authentication, and styling styling)
